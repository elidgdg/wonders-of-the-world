        <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>

        <p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus
            , stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro.
        </p>
        <p>Its origins date to just after World War I, when some
            Brazillians feared a "tide of godlessness." They proposed
            a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor de
            Silva Costa, Carlos Oswals, and Paul Landowski. Construction
            began in 1926 and was completed five years later. The resulting
            monument stands 98 feet tall, not including its base,
            which is about 26 feet high. Its outstretched arms span 92
            feet.
