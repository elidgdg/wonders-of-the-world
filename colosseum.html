        <h2>The Colosseum</h2>

        <p>The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by
            order of the Emperor Vespasian.
        </p>
        <p>A feat of engineering, the ampitheater measures
            620 by 513 feet and features a complex system of vaults.
            It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, 
            who watches a variety of events. Perhaps most notable
            were gladiator fights, though men battling animals
            was also common.
