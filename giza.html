        <h2>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h2>

        <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the biggest Egyptian
            pyramid and the tomb of the Fourth Dynasty pharoh
            Khufu.
        </p>
        <p>Built in the early 26th century BC during a period 
            of around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the
            Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one
            to remain largely intact.
