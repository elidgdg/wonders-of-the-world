        <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>

        <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel
            located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern
            Peru on a 2,430-meter mountain ridge.
        </p>
        <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was "discovered"
            in 1911 by Hiram Binham, who believed it was Vilcabamba,
            a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century 
            rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that claim was
            later disproved, the purpose of Macu Picchu has confounded 
            scholars.
