        <h2>Petra</h2>

        <p>The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote
            valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs.
        </p>
        <p>It was purported to be one of the places where Moses
            struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later the 
            Nabateans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and
            during this time it flourished, becoming an important
            trade center, especially for spices.
            Noted carvers, the Nabateans chiseled dwellings, temples
            and tombs into the sandstone, which changed colour in the
            shifting sun.
