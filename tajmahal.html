        <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>

        <p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India is regarded as
            one of the world's most iconic monuments and is perhaps
            the finest examplle of Mughal architecture.
        </p>
        <p>It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628-58) to honor
            his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631 giving birth to
            their 14th child.
            It took 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the 
            complex, which includes an immense garden with a reflecting
            pool.
