        <h2>The Great Wall of China</h2>

        <p>One of the world's largest building-construction projects
            , the Great Wall of China is widely thought to be about
            5,500 miles long.
        </p>
        <p>Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two
            millenia. Although called a "wall," the structure
            actually features two parallel walls for lengthy stretches.
            In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark.
